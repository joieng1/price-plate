## Price Plate

Price Plate is an everyday budgeting tool that allows financially aware shoppers and consumers to track the prices of the ingredients they purchase and the meals they make with them. Given the price paid for the total ingredients and the recipes you create, Price Plate can find out the exact prices for different recipes and allow the user to track their expenses. Gone are the days of manually using spreadsheets, and in are the days of automation with Price Plate.
